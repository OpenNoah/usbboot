# How to build USB Boot Software
#

The USB Boot Software include two part
1.Host driver and USB Boot API
2.Device driver and routines


Host part
	To modify and build host source you need following IDE:
	1.Visual Studio .net 2003
	2.Compuware Driver Studio 3.1
	3.DDK for windows XP/2k
	We recommand you modify and build host source on Windows XP.

	Build host source just use the menu of windows IDE,
	before that you should open the project in IDE.
	When IDE are ready,just double click at 'Usb_Boot.sln'.


Device part
	The device source can divided into two part:
	1.stage1
	2.stage2
	To obtain the compiler from Ingenic ftp server.

	Stage1:
	First enable the no-pic compiler show as above.
	Then into the directory : ./device/stage1/fw
	$ cd ./device/stage1/fw
	Just make at last:
	$ make
	If build is ok,the output binary file is :fw.bin

	Stage2:
	First enable the no-pic compiler show as above.
	Then into the directory :./device/stage2
	$ cd ./device/stage2/
	Just make at last:
	$ make
	If build is ok,the output binary file is :usb_boot.bin


For more detail you can consult makefile, <Usb Boot Mannul> and <Usb Boot Guide>.
